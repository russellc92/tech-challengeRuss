AA technical challenge. Full stack.

###Â API

### Design choices

#### Classification algo

### Transparency and Attribution

The majority of the boilerplate code for the back end service "classification.service" was generated via the open source repository created by Hagop Jamkojian, available at [this repository](https://github.com/hagopj13/node-express-boilerplate). Applicable licenses available in ./classification-service/licenses/

This includes setting sensible defaults for a nodejs express production application - with modifications made to fit the purpose of this challenge.

The business logic code created to fulfill the requirements of the technical challenge was written entirely by myself and incorporated into this nodejs express.

Justification:

```
Whilst I could write an entire node express app from scratch, I deemed it appropiate to use an open source template which achieves the same (and more considering the time frame)
```
